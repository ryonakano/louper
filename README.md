# Louper

![](data/Screenshot.png)

Louper is a text magnification app designed for elementary OS. Prototype for https://github.com/elementary/wingpanel-indicator-a11y/issues/35

## Usage

1. Select some text
2. Launch the app (it is recommended to assign a shortcut key in Keyboard Settings). The app shows the selected text in huge size
3. Press `Ctrl+C` to copy the text showing
4. Press `Esc` or unfocus the window to close the app

## Installation

**Louper will be published to AppCenter when elementary OS 6 is out.** This is because a dependency (libhandy-1) is not available on elementary OS 5.x. For now you can test the app by building and installing from source.

### For Developers

You'll need the following dependencies to build:

* libgranite-dev (>= 5.4.0)
* libgtk-3.0-dev
* libhandy-1-dev
* meson
* valac

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment. Change to the build directory and run `ninja` to build

    meson build --prefix=/usr
    cd build
    ninja

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `com.github.ryonakano.louper`

    ninja install
    com.github.ryonakano.louper
